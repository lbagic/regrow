# Attack plan — personal-first regrow

**Status:** rev 2 (2026-10-04) — revised after a three-critic blind review (data model, failure modes, premises). Implements the [direction doc](2026-10-04-direction.md) (D1–D6). One coordinator session executes it; each numbered PR below is one PR. The review's verbatim reports live outside the repo, on the owner's machine (`~/.claude/handoffs/regrow-blind-review-2026-10-04/tri-critic-attack-plan.md`).

## Outcome

This Mac stops running out of space, in two regimes:

- **Slow regrowth** (days): the owner is warned before the disk fills, the Go build cache is trimmed under the agreed policy, and residue is listed with owners and regeneration stories.
- **Acute pressure** (minutes): a fast fall in free space or a swap jump raises an alert naming the top process.

Scans never hang. Every total says which bucket it belongs to: frees now, frees after the Trash is emptied, shown only, macOS-managed.

## Phase 0 — owner checklist (minutes, not a PR; first checkpoint)

Nothing in PRs 1–3 frees a byte, and the disk loses ~14 GB/day in bursts. Before the build starts, the owner (or the coordinator, with the owner's yes for each line) does:

1. `go clean -cache` (55 GiB; regrows).
2. Decide `-trimpath`: globally (`go env -w GOFLAGS=-trimpath`) or only in the agent harness env. Trade-off: debugger/stack-trace paths become module-relative. Worktrees at the same code then share cache entries; 149 cache files over 100 MB are ~24 copies each of six packages.
3. Switch the wallpaper/screensaver off aerial shuffle.
4. Cap Docker Desktop's VM memory (today's jetsam event's largest process was the Docker VM at 8 GiB resident on a 16 GiB host).
5. Reboot when convenient (clears ~15 GiB of agent scratch in `/private/tmp`).

Record the before/after free space in the PR 1 description.

## Fences (every PR)

- **Safety invariants** (ARCHITECTURE.md) hold. The single sanctioned exception is the go-build prune in PR 4; it crosses invariant 1 (no per-run opt-in once autopilot is on), invariant 2 (direct delete, no Trash) and invariant 4 (raw delete, no steward command), and its decisions-log entry and amended invariant text name all three.
- **Tests never touch the owner's data.** Executor, Mover, Journal, `RunNative` and the state dir are injected. Tests that execute use a synthetic catalog of trash-only rules rooted in a temp home — never `LoadEmbedded` — a `RunNative` that fails the test if called, and `XDG_STATE_HOME` in a temp dir. Selection logic is tested as pure functions, never through `run([]string{...})`, which scans the real `$HOME`. `Host.Root` re-anchors paths only, never native argv.
- **Nothing is deleted on the real machine** during development, except Phase 0 lines the owner approves and the owner-checkpoint runs below.
- **Disk headroom for the build itself:** check free space before each phase and stop below 20 GiB. Subagent worktrees each compile Go and SwiftPM writes `.build`; set `GOFLAGS=-trimpath` in subagent shells regardless of the owner's global choice.
- **Memory-light:** stream large data; after background jobs, check for orphaned processes (ppid 1) and kill your own.
- **Public repo:** no client project names or personal paths in code, fixtures, commits or docs; recorded docker/git/plist output is scrubbed or synthetic.
- **Commits and PRs** are authored as the owner with no AI attribution or trailers. Every PR gets `/code-review` via an Opus agent before its last push, then babysitting until CI is green and bot threads are answered.
- `go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...` green; every new or changed rule keeps its golden fixture. The Go engine stays CGO-free.
- **CLT-only Swift** (no Xcode): no XCTest (use swift-testing), no `#Preview`, no asset catalogs/xibs (`actool`/`ibtool` need Xcode; icons are `iconutil` .icns or SF Symbols), no SwiftPM resources (`Bundle.module` falls back to `.build` paths and breaks after `swift package clean`; copy the page into `Contents/Resources` or serve it from the engine's `go:embed`).
- Tick `docs/PLAN.md` Status per merged PR and keep its "Now:" line current.

## Data shapes (pin these; do not invent alternatives per PR)

```go
// internal/scanner/size.go — the one definition of size and recency
type Usage struct{ Bytes int64; Newest time.Time; Partial bool }
func DirSize(ctx context.Context, path string) (Usage, error) // error is ctx only

// internal/engine/finding.go — Item stays pure scan output
type Item struct {
	Path, Label, Key, Arg string
	Bytes    int64     `json:"bytes"`              // whole item, nested items included
	LastUsed time.Time `json:"last_used,omitzero"` // Usage.Newest (files AND dirs), or tool-reported
	Partial  bool      `json:"partial,omitempty"`  // Bytes/LastUsed are lower bounds: something refused or blocked
}
// Finding.Err stays for rule-level failures only (tool missing, unknown query).

// internal/engine/account.go — containment is computed, never stored
type Totals struct{ FreesNow, AfterTrash, ShownOnly, MacOSManaged int64; Partial int }
type Ledger struct {
	Exclusive map[string]int64 // item ID → Bytes − Σ Bytes of direct children
	Totals    Totals
}
func Account(findings []Finding) Ledger
func DefaultSelection(findings []Finding) map[string]bool // safe ∧ items ∧ no Err; every face calls this
```

- **Containment forest:** an item's parent is the nearest item from any rule whose path strictly contains it; on equal paths the later rule in catalog order is the child. Every measured byte lands in exactly one item.
- **Buckets** derive from the rule, no new field: native command → FreesNow; trash rules → AfterTrash (a Finder move frees nothing until the Trash is emptied); surface-only → ShownOnly; phantom-space category → MacOSManaged.
- **Planner uses the same forest:** an item whose ancestor is also selected is skipped ("inside X, also selected"); an actionable item with a surface-only descendant is refused ("contains Y, which regrow never deletes"); `Plan.TotalBytes` is the union.
- **Schema:** `empties_trash: true` (validated: native command, not per-item, not `safe`) — the planner orders such actions **first**, so this run's trash moves stay restorable. `prune:` block (PR 4). `Action.Sudo bool`.
- **Doctor verdict** is three-way: flagged (lower bound already over the line), normal (complete and under), unknown (partial and under).

## PR 1 — Planner safety (branch from `plan/personal-first`; no prototype code)

B5 is live on `main` through `regrow clean` and the TUI.

- `empties_trash` on `trash-empty`, ordered first.
- The containment forest in `BuildPlan` (subsume nested selections, refuse surface-only descendants, union total).
- `engine.DefaultSelection`; `plan` with no ids and the TUI both call it. Empty or missing ids in any programmatic call mean an empty plan, never "everything".
- Plan screen and `clean` summary show FreesNow / AfterTrash subtotals and per-action reversibility; remove the blanket "Trash first, undo restores" copy (`tui.go` plan footer, `clean.go` total line).
- `regrow help` / `--help` prints the subcommand usage.

Done when: a multi-rule plan test (the golden harness scans one rule per subtest, so this is a new test) shows `trash-empty` first; a fixture run of trash-empty + one trash move leaves the move restorable by `Undo`; tests for subsumption, surface-only refusal, union total, empty-ids → empty plan.

## PR 2 — Scan correctness

Port `ScanStream` and the 4-worker `DirSize` from `proto/web-serve` commit `93e0f1f`, then fix what the prototype got wrong:

- **Every open is bounded**, not just the root: the walker's opener is injectable; a per-item watchdog abandons a walk whose directories stop completing for N s and returns the bytes so far with `Partial: true`. Same bound for glob expansion parents, discover walks and the hf/ollama walkers. Remember blocked paths per process (no re-probing, no goroutine pile-up); probes honour ctx. The message says "blocked or unreadable (Full Disk Access may be needed)", not a certain diagnosis.
- `Usage` / `Item.Partial`; a blocked root is `Item{Path, Partial: true}`, not `Finding.Err`. `LastUsed` = newest mtime over files and directories (npm stamps 1985 on package files). `hfLastUsed` uses `Usage.Newest`.
- `Account` and the four buckets in scan text, TUI and `--json`; display "unreadable" (partial, ~0 B) vs "≥ X, some folders unreadable".
- Doctor three-way verdict.
- `node-modules-dirs` `max_depth` 6 → 10.
- Docker build-cache figure (B7): find why the rule claims 1.6 GiB unused-30d+ while `docker system df` says 0 reclaimable; fix the query or the label; note the cause in the decisions log.

Done when: injected-blocking-opener tests at depth ≥ 2 and on a glob parent, asserting the scan **returns** and the process exits; three-level nesting fixture (exclusive(A) = A − B) and an equal-path fixture; a two-actionable-rules fixture for totals (a surface-only container would pass trivially); `chmod 000` fixture with `t.Cleanup` restoring mode; full `regrow scan` wall time before/after recorded in the PR; node_modules count compared with a `find` that mirrors discover's excludes.

## PR 3 — Engine protocol (`regrow engine`, documented in `docs/ENGINE.md`)

JSON lines over stdin/stdout, written by one goroutine fed from a buffered channel (a slow reader never blocks the scan or `cancel`).

| Request | Events (each carries `re` = request id) | Terminal |
|---|---|---|
| process start | `hello{protocol:1, version, fda}` — `fda` from a bounded `readdir` of a classic TCC path (`~/.Trash`, `~/Library/Safari`), never an app container | — |
| `scan{id}` | `headroom{Sample}`, `start{scan_id, rules}`, per rule `finding{scan_id, index, took_ms, finding}` + `summary{scan_id, totals, exclusive}` | `done{elapsed_ms, canceled}` |
| `plan{id, scan_id, select?}` | `plan{plan_id, plan, totals}`; sudo actions already Skips ("needs administrator rights — run `regrow clean <id>` in Terminal"); no `select` → `DefaultSelection`; empty `select` → empty plan | `done` / `error` (unknown, canceled or superseded scan) |
| `execute{id, plan_id}` | `journal{entry}` per oplog append, emitted after the sync | `done{result}`; plan consumed |
| `cancel{id, target}` | target ends with `done{canceled:true}`; an execute stops between actions | `done` |
| `tick{id, autotrim}` | `tick{Tick}` (PR 4) | `done` |

Rules: one scan or execute in flight (`error{busy}` otherwise); a new scan supersedes plans from older scans; `plan_id` is the oplog run id, unguessable, single-use, expires after 10 min; on stdin EOF cancel a scan but let an execute finish and journal its current action, then exit; request lines up to 1 MiB, longer → `error`; native commands run through an engine `RunNative` with `/dev/null` stdin and captured stdout/stderr (tail into the journal's error) — never the TUI's inherited stdio; `regrow scan --json` emits the same lines minus `hello`.

Done when: an in-process test drives scan → plan → execute over pipes against a synthetic trash-only catalog (fences above) and checks the event sequence and oplog; tests for cancel-then-rescan, empty `select`, double execute of one plan, an undrained reader, EOF mid-execute, an over-long line, a native command that writes to stdout and reads stdin.

## PR 4 — Headroom and prune, Go only (the piece that stops the crunch)

No Swift, no Full Disk Access needed (`go-build` and statfs are not TCC-gated); runnable from the terminal if the menubar slips.

```go
// internal/headroom
type Sample struct {
	At        time.Time `json:"at"`
	Total     int64     `json:"total"`
	Free      int64     `json:"free"`      // statfs f_bavail (df); thresholds use this
	Purgeable int64     `json:"purgeable"` // existing APFS query
	SwapUsed  int64     `json:"swap_used"`
}
func Take(ctx context.Context) (Sample, error)
func Append(path string, s Sample) error          // ~/.local/state/regrow/headroom.jsonl, 30 days
func Tail(path string, since time.Time) ([]Sample, error) // skips malformed lines (ENOSPC partial writes)
func Forecast(s []Sample) (daysToFull float64, ok bool)    // window resets at upward jumps; ≤ 72 h
func Alerts(prev, cur []Sample) []Alert                     // crossings only
type Tick struct { Sample; DaysToFull *float64; Alerts []Alert; Pruned *PruneResult }
```

- Alerts are crossings with hysteresis: free-space bands 50/25/10/5 GiB, days-to-full crossing 3, swap up ≥ 4 GiB, and acute: free fell > 5 GiB within 30 min (name the top process by resident memory). No `used` field (on APFS `total − used ≠ free`). `headroom.jsonl` is not the oplog.
- **Prune** as a rule block, executed as an ordinary plan action:
  ```yaml
  # rules/go-build-cache.yaml
  prune:
    min_age: 48h
    keep_under: 15GiB
    unless_running: [go, compile, link]
  ```
  `PrunePlan` walks the cache once into an hourly mtime histogram (memory O(hours)), picks cutoff T where oldest-first bytes reach `min(cache − keep_under, target − free)` with T ≤ now − min_age, and emits `Action{Kind: "prune", Command: find <GOCACHE> -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type f -name '*-[ad]' ! -newermt <T> -delete, Bytes: estimate}` (find re-stats each file, so entries used since planning survive). The planner refuses unless `<GOCACHE>/README` carries Go's cache header and the path came from `go env GOCACHE` under the owner's login environment.
- Stop on bytes against the target computed up front; report statfs before/after separately (TM snapshots can hold freed blocks). Single-flight via flock on a state file. Journal start and done/fail with actual count and bytes. If a build is running, defer; after 2 h of continuous deferral with free < 10 GiB, prune anyway (entries used in the last 48 h are spared by the cutoff regardless).
- `regrow tick` (one sample + alerts, printed) and `regrow prune go-build` (dry-run by default, `--yes` executes). `tick{autotrim:true}` refuses until the oplog holds a completed prune of that rule, so "on only after one manual run" is enforced by data.
- Decisions-log entry + amended invariant text (1, 2, 4).

Done when: unit tests for forecast (including a jump fixture), alert crossings and hysteresis, the tolerant reader, `PrunePlan` on a fixture cache with controlled mtimes and decoys (`README`, `trim.txt`, `testexpire.txt`, non-matching names), the README/GOCACHE refusal, the deferral rule; **owner checkpoint**: the owner runs `regrow prune go-build`, reviews the dry run, then `--yes` once.

## PR 5 — Menubar shell (CLT-only SwiftUI)

- **Signing** (`scripts/signing-cert.sh`, owner asked Claude to script it): creates a self-signed code-signing identity "regrow local signing", validity ≥ 10 years, via `/usr/bin/openssl` (LibreSSL PKCS#12 that macOS imports) and `security import … -T /usr/bin/codesign`; records its SHA-1 in a gitignored local file; a re-run is a provable no-op (same hash); `just app` signs by that hash, never by name; codesign runs under a timeout. **Tell the owner before running it** — the first key use raises a keychain dialog; they click "Always Allow".
- **Environment:** apps launched by LaunchServices get `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` (docker, go, brew vanish; `GOCACHE`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `HF_HOME` differ). The app captures the login shell's environment once (`$SHELL -lic env`, bounded) and passes it to the engine; a tool missing from that PATH is a visible state, not "does not apply".
- **App:** `MenuBarExtra` shows free / purgeable / swap and days-to-full; a timer (15 min and on wake) sends `tick` and posts the returned alerts via `UNUserNotificationCenter`; the autotrim toggle sends `tick{autotrim:true}`. "Scan…" opens a window: `WKWebView` with the prototype page rewired to the engine protocol, navigation denied after the initial load. Execute behind the TUI's double confirm. FDA state from `hello.fda`, with a button opening the Full Disk Access pane and "relaunch to apply". Staging bytes shown with a way to empty them.
- **Install:** `just app` builds, quits a running Regrow, waits for its engine to exit, swaps the bundle atomically into `~/Applications`, registers `SMAppService.mainApp` only from there.

Done when: `just app` builds from the CLT only; the app launches into the menu bar; a scan streams; ticks produce a notification; a **non-destructive smoke test through the real bundle** trashes a sentinel file the test created under `$HOME` and undoes it (proves Finder Automation consent, oplog, receipt, undo); after the owner grants Full Disk Access, a rebuild keeps it (a scan still reads `~/.Trash`).

## PR 6+ — Coverage for this machine (one rule family per PR, any order after PR 2)

Catalog test first: no two rules share a literal path or a discover `name` (one owner per byte).

1. **Agent sessions** (largest regrowing owner here): scratch dirs under `/private/tmp/claude-<uid>/` keyed by session id; live = a running process for that session or transcript activity within N hours; dead sessions' scratch → caution. Their worktrees belong to rule 2.
2. **Git worktrees**, whole-worktree removal only: merged (ancestry, or upstream gone) + `git status --ignored --porcelain` shows nothing beyond allowlisted build dirs + idle ≥ 7 days → `git -C {path} worktree remove {path}` (not `-C {arg}`: `Arg` is the item key, and a shared repo arg would make all worktrees of a repo one item).
3. **Build output** (`.next`, `dist`, `.turbo`, `.venv`) in projects idle N days, one rule; only `git check-ignore`d dirs (tracked `dist/` exists). `node_modules` stays with `node-modules-dirs`, `target` with `rust-target-dirs`.
4. **Docker unused images** (no container uses them, older than N days).
5. **Toolchains:** Node versions nothing references (guard versions named in LaunchAgent plists, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`); Android NDKs/SDK with no Studio; simulator runtime with no Xcode (root-owned → surface-only with instructions).
6. **App leftovers** (needs the app's Full Disk Access to be meaningful): `~/Library/{Application Support,Containers,Group Containers,Caches,…}/<id>` with no installed owner — enumeration covers `/Applications`, `~/Applications`, `/System/Applications`, `PlugIns/*.appex` ids and installed apps' `application-groups` entitlements; idle ≥ 90 days → caution, to Trash. Fuzzy matches are a separate surface-only rule (risk is per rule).
7. **Small fry:** installers in `~/Downloads` for apps already installed, npx cache, stale macOS installer data (surface + how), browser on-device models (surface).
8. **Fix-the-cause rows** (doctor): aerial shuffle on, many Go worktrees without `-trimpath`, Docker VM memory cap and build-cache limit unset.
9. **regrow-trash expiry** (later, owner checkpoint): permanently delete items regrow itself trashed more than N days ago, from oplog receipts — frees space without ever emptying the owner's own Trash.

## Owner checkpoints

Phase 0 · before the signing script runs (keychain dialog) · first `regrow prune go-build --yes` · first real execute from the app (Finder Automation prompt) · enabling autotrim · granting Full Disk Access to `Regrow.app`.

## Out of scope

Launch work (Prompt I, M2 publish, notarization, brew), Linux, TUI improvements beyond PR 1's copy fixes (frozen), Electron/Tauri, `getattrlistbulk` and a persistent FSEvents index, per-file clone/hardlink-aware sizing (noted: pnpm hardlinks and APFS clones make path-unique bytes an overestimate for some build dirs).
